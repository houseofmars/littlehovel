#### Mythology 

<p style="font-family: times, serif; font-size:11pt">
I’ve realized that I have such an aversion to genuine connection and emotional vulnerability. There’s a part of me that fears weighing others down with my past pain, 
and another that wants to maintain a mythology of myself. It’s much easier to stay a Zeus, an Anansi, a Yellow Emperor then be seen as a human. I want to be marveled at, 
to never be touched, to always be separate. I want to cloak myself in the smoke of mythology, to veil my human dimension. I want the knowledge of my suffering lost to time.
